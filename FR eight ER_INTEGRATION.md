# Freighter Integration Complete! üéâ

## What Was Fixed

Your escrow payments weren't working because:
1. ‚ùå XDR transactions were created but never signed
2. ‚ùå XDRs were never submitted to the blockchain
3. ‚ùå No actual payment occurred

## What's Been Added

‚úÖ **Freighter wallet integration**
- Installed `@stellar/freighter-api` package
- Created signing utilities in `src/client/utils/freighterSigning.ts`
- Updated job approval flow to sign and submit XDRs

‚úÖ **Backend XDR submission endpoint**
- New `/api/jobs/submit-xdr` endpoint
- Submits signed XDRs to blockchain via Trustless API
- Proper error handling and logging

‚úÖ **Frontend signing flow**
- Check for Freighter wallet availability
- Sign each XDR transaction (fund, approve, release)
- Submit signed XDRs to blockchain
- Show progress toasts to user

## How It Works Now

### When Employer Approves Work:

1. **Backend** creates 3 XDR transactions:
   - Fund escrow (employer pays money)
   - Approve milestone (work is verified)
   - Release funds (money goes to employee)

2. **Frontend** handles signing:
   - Prompts user to sign with Freighter wallet
   - Signs all 3 transactions sequentially
   - Submits each signed transaction to blockchain
   - Shows progress updates

3. **Blockchain** processes the transactions:
   - Escrow is funded with employer's USDC
   - Milestone is approved
   - Funds are released to employee
   - ‚úÖ **ACTUAL PAYMENT OCCURS**

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Install [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app) browser extension
2. Create a testnet wallet in Freighter
3. Fund it with test USDC from faucet

### Test Flow:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Backend
cd src/server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Start Frontend  
cd /Users/adityarvij/Desktop/hackathons/stellar-proj
npm start
```

### Steps to Test:

1. **Start servers** (see commands above)

2. **Connect Freighter**
   - Open Freighter extension
   - Make sure it's on TESTNET
   - Add testnet account if needed

3. **Post a Job**
   - Login as employer
   - Post a job with some budget
   - Make sure you have USDC in your wallet

4. **Claim the Job**
   - Login as employee (or different account)
   - Claim the job
   - Check server logs - escrow should be created

5. **Submit Work**
   - As employee, click "Submit Work"
   - Job status changes to "submitted"

6. **Approve & Pay** ‚≠ê **THE IMPORTANT PART**
   - Login as employer
   - Click "Verify Work"
   - **Freighter popup should appear** requesting signature
   - Sign the transaction(s)
   - Watch console logs for progress

7. **Check Payment**
   - Employee's wallet should receive USDC
   - Job status should be "completed"
   - Database shows escrow_id

## What to Watch in Console Logs

### Backend (Terminal 1):
```
üì• REQUEST: POST /api/jobs/xxx/approve
=== ESCROW APPROVAL PROCESS ===
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Returning XDRs to frontend for signing...
Getting funding XDR for amount: 10000000
‚úÖ Funding XDR received
‚úÖ Approval XDR received
‚úÖ Release XDR received
=== RETURNING XDRs TO FRONTEND ===
```

### Frontend (Browser Console):
```
Checking Freighter availability...
Signing and submitting fund XDR...
‚úÖ Fund transaction submitted
‚úÖ Approve transaction submitted
‚úÖ Release transaction submitted
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Freighter wallet required" error

**Cause:** Freighter extension not installed or not connected

**Fix:**
1. Install Freighter from https://freighter.app
2. Connect your wallet in the extension
3. Make sure you're on TESTNET

### Issue: "Failed to submit transaction"

**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient balance (need USDC in wallet)
- Wrong network (make sure TESTNET)
- Invalid XDR format

**Fix:** Check server logs for detailed error

### Issue: Transactions partially complete

**Scenario:** 1 or 2 XDRs submitted successfully but one fails

**Recovery:** 
- Check escrow status on Stellar
- May need to manually submit remaining XDRs
- Server logs will show which ones succeeded

## Network Configuration

The code is set to **TESTNET** by default. To use **MAINNET**:

1. Edit `src/client/utils/freighterSigning.ts`
2. Change `network: 'TESTNET'` to `'MAINNET'`
3. Update backend to use mainnet endpoints

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** Never use mainnet for testing! Always test on testnet first.

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoint: `POST /api/jobs/submit-xdr`

Submits a signed XDR to the blockchain:

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3002/api/jobs/submit-xdr', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ signed_xdr: 'XDR_HERE' })
})
```

## Files Changed

1. ‚úÖ `package.json` - Added `@stellar/freighter-api`
2. ‚úÖ `src/client/utils/freighterSigning.ts` - New signing utilities
3. ‚úÖ `src/client/pages/JobDetails.tsx` - Updated approval flow
4. ‚úÖ `src/server/route/jobs.js` - Added XDR submission endpoint

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Safe:**
- Private keys stay in Freighter (never accessed by server)
- XDRs are signed client-side
- Only signed XDRs are submitted to blockchain

‚ùå **What NOT to do:**
- Don't store private keys in backend
- Don't send private keys to server
- Don't use mainnet until thoroughly tested

## Next Steps

1. Test the full flow end-to-end
2. Monitor server logs for errors
3. Check blockchain explorer for transactions
4. Test with actual USDC amounts
5. Add error recovery for failed transactions

## Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ‚úÖ Freighter popup appears when approving
- ‚úÖ Transactions appear in Freighter transaction history
- ‚úÖ Employee receives USDC in their wallet
- ‚úÖ Server logs show "Transaction submitted successfully"
- ‚úÖ Job status changes to "completed"

## Questions?

Check:
- Server console logs for detailed error messages
- Browser console for frontend errors
- Freighter extension for transaction status

Good luck! üöÄ
